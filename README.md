# StudentPerformanceEvaluation

## This problem aims at predicting students learning based on logs of tutoring systems. Here we have to find if a student can give correct answer to a problem on the first attempt. So, our target/response variable here is Correct.First.Attempt, according to our dataset. As it has a binary output, 0 or 1, we can define it as a classification problem.
Very large datasets and highly categorical features are the two main aspects of this project. Missing values are also a challenging problem when we are dealing with a very large training datasets. Moreover, most classifiers are not performing efficiently on large datasets. So far in this project I have tried to fit a model using Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis.
